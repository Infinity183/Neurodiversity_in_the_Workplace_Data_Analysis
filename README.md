# Nuerodiversity_in_the_Workplace_Data_Analysis
A data science project on cruise line for Nuerodiversity in the workplace training
We will be analysing market research data on cruise lines

The file paths to the raw data in this project use the unix standard for file paths (ie: /path/to/file.txt)
as oposed to the dos standard (ie: C:\path\to\file.txt) so the r source files may need alterations to run on Windows

For this Project, we are dividing the work up into two groups:

Machine Learning: Austin Reuter, Austin Richardson Solorizano, Jason Freedman, Jacob Rachal

Bussiness Inteligence: Sid, Ted Chang, Jacquline Sailer, David Chidester
